# Facebook Messenger Bot

This example project creates a Facebook Messenger bot, completely
mirroring the quick start located in [Messenger Platform docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start).

It's basically an echo bot that responds to a user's message by repeating their message back to them. It also sends a generic template when a message with "generic" text is received. This project is not dependent on any external libraries and can easily be extended.

In order to use this bot, you have to be logged into Blackboard, and the link takes you directly to the course's homepage.

I am currently working on a way to make the bot tell the user when exactly assignments are due. This will help a lot of students as they are often bombarded with lots of assignments and keep missing deadlines.
